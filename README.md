# ConfigClassToJsonC
This library can be used to take any C# class (but specifically with configuration style classes in mind) and export it to a JSON string, along with it's XmlDoc output to the JSON file along with it. This is useful for creating ad-hoc documentation for your config files for when other people need to make modifications to them.
